[Road Accident Predictor](https://github.com/antinayeh/Projects/blob/main/U_S_Road_Accident_Predictor.ipynb)
  Explored a variety of machine learning models that identifies factors contributing to road accidents and predicts the likelihood of future accidents based on those factors. Project performs data processing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis on U.S. accident dataset. Models explored include logistic regression, KNN, and decision tree models. The final decision tree model has a training accuracy of 0.66 and f1 score of 0.65.
